Calling classes inside IMA25.

For an ATL template, the pointer of a given class must be placed in the header file.
The constructor should have the pointer set to NULL
The CPP file is the one where 'new' is used to allocate sufficient memory for the class.
Otherwise the Class object will be out of scope.
