Hey Roberto, 
In Manager Book for the Load and Save As functions, you are doing so from some files that were in your desktop. I do not know what files are those, and so can't get them.

Here is the code:
    
    Private Sub mnuFile_Load_Click()
    
    Call mtb.LoadFromFile("C:\Documents and Settings\olivarre\Desktop\file1.mgf")
    
    End Sub

...

    Private Sub mnuFile_SaveAs_Click()
    
        Call mtb.SaveToFile("C:\Documents and Settings\olivarre\Desktop\file1.mgf")

What were these?
