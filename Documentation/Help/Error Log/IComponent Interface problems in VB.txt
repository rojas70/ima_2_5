IComponent Interface problems in VB
Date: 4/9/04

I have been having some compile erros in VB for different projects and I think they are related to the IComponent Interface. I know that IComponent is defined in IMA2.tlb. This library is included in the Project references option in VB, and it is selected.

The ManagerBook problem that I am facing right now is the following:

(1)
VB can't find the PID property for:
-------------------
CPID = Cmp.PID
-------------------
Where Cmp is defined As IComponent.

In looking at the Object Browswer, the following objects have a PID Property in them:
IMA2_Helper.ClsInfo
IMA2_Helper.CmpDesc
IMA2_HelperX.PIDBar
IMA2.IMA2_Distributing Info

(2)
For the SampleComponents project, for the Mech (Engine.cls), there is a compile error for the following line:
----------------------------------
Implements IComponent
----------------------------------

It states: Object module needs to implement 'Distributing' for interface 'IComponent'.


I looked at this problem in MSDN and it states:

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;170158
"An interface is a collection of unimplemented procedure prototypes. This error occurs when you specified an interface in an Implements statement, but you failed to add code for all the procedures in the interface. 

You must write code for all procedures specified in the interface. An empty procedure containing only a comment is sufficient. "


It seems like under the definition for IComponent, there is no place where the Distributing Method is defined. What I was thinking is looking at the code present in the IMA2 VB Template and use the definition of the Distributing Method:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private Property Get IComponent_Distributing() As IMA2.IMA2_DistributingInfo
    IComponent_Distributing = m_DistributingInfo
End Property
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
