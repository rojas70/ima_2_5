Please look in Octavia:

C:\IMA2\Components\ISAC_ControlBAsis.

It's a little different. 
When you build it, it only creates the .dll locally.

If you run the control basis project in the O:\drive in Octavia it will overide the modified .dll.

In that case, you will have to open the local control basis project and rec-build it.
