Left Arm values found in January of 2006 by Juan Rojas.
As we build the components for the controller and the sampler for IMA 2.5, 
we are revisiting or recomputing values for the left arm.

From the original Sampler component in IMA 1.0, it seems that the values 
for the InvertPressure are:

InvertPressure

1
0
1
0
1
0

By moving the arm to the home position and using the tools found in O:\System\Tools\Softarm Encoder Arm Test

We computed the following offsets:

Encoder Offset

  2062
 -6831
 10446
-11708
   833
-29764
