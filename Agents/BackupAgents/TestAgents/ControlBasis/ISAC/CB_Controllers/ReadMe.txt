Each folder represents a type of controller for the control basis:

P - position controller.
F - force controller.
M - moment controller.

Two lettered folders represent hierarchies:

FM - force-moment controller, where the force controller is the dominant controller.
MF - would be moment-force controller. 

To activate the controllers:
(Make sure the air vavles are powered and running).

Click load and start on the state machine that belongs to the CB agent.
Normally there are only two state machines in all of the agents. One
for the force sensor and one for the CB component. 

The CB state machine is like the brain and will run all other components.
