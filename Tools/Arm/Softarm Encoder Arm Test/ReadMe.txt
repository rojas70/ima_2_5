These files are designed to calibrate the encoder values for when the arm 
is in the home position.

Turn the arm on. Then we can proceed in the following way:

(1)	Use the ArmTest.exe to move the arm to the home position. 
	This is something that you need to do simply by observation.

(2) 	Record the values of the joings. Then open the EncOffSetTool.exe
	Type in the recorded values for the joints and click compute. 

	The encoder offset values will then be displayed.

	You can also use the ComputeEncoderOffsetValues.exe
