/**** DEVICE DRIVER FOR ARMS ***/

The three files found in this folder are to be used only when there is a need to install/reinstall
the device driver for the right arm or left arm in a new machine. 


/*** INSTALLING THE DRIVER ***/

To install the driver, simply double click on:

Left Arm:	HungerForceSoftarm.reg
Right Arm:	PopeyeSoftarm.reg

Then finally double click on:

Sofarm.sys

For both arms. 

This should install the driver on your computer. Note that you will probably have to do this if, for some reason, you are reinstalling the arm card on a new machine or a formatted machine. 

/*** CHECKING ***/

To check to make sure that the driver was successfully installed in your machine do the following:

Go to MyComputer,
Right Click on it, and select Properties,
Click on the Hardware Tab, and select Device Manager,
Go to the View Menu, and select Show Hidden Devices,
Go to the View Menu again, and select the Devices by Connection option
At this point you should be able to scroll down the list and see a SoftArm icon listed there.

If for any reason the files here get corrupted or lost! you can find a copy at:
\\cis\common\Users\palis\Softarm


/*** INSTALLING THE HARDWARE CARD***/

This is simple. Both in Brutus and HungerForce you will be able to locate special ISA slots in which you can place these cards. 
The cables that go into these cards, are all tied together by color and label on the floor and so should be easy to recongnize.

A simple logic is all you need to put this together.
