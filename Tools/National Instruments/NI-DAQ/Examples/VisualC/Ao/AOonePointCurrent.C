/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    AOonePointCurrent.c
*
* Description: 
*    Output one channel, one current value point at a time, immediately
*     (first output 5mA then 0A)
*
* Example Category: 
*    AO
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    1PT, 1CH, IMMED, INTTIM
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    iChan
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    AO_Change_Parameter, NIDAQErrorHandler, NIDAQWaitForKey, AO_VWrite
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    The analog output current signal will be available at AO current
*     channel 0.  Please note that on some devices, the current output
*     and the voltage output may be on different I/O connector pins.
*     Also, some devices may require an external power source to drive
*     the current.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
