Thank you for purchasing the Imagenation PXC200A frame grabber. 
The PXC200A is a replacement for the PXC200. The drivers, and 
DLLs, and samples on this disk are fully compatible with both 
versions of the PXC including the following models.

      PXC200L
      PXC200AL
      PXC200F
      PXC200AF




                   Floppy Disk Organization
                   ------------------------

This disk contains the following subdirectories.
   
   BIN: 
       Contains drivers, DLLs, and executable copies of the 
       samples.

   LIB: 
       Contains the libraries required for linking to the PXC 
       and FRAME DLLs. These libraries are also duplicated in 
       each of the samples' subdirectories for convenience.

   INCLUDE: 
       Contains all header files required for compiling against 
       the PXC, FRAME, and DirectDraw DLLs. Also contains all 
       of the Visual Basic BAS files. The files in this 
       subdirectory are also duplicated in each of the samples' 
       subdirectories for convenience.

   SAMPLES: 
       Contains a subdirectory for each sample and/or a 
       subdirectory for groups of samples such as PXCDD, the 
       DirectDraw samples subdirectory. The subdirectory for 
       each individual sample contains all of the headers and 
       libraries required to build that sample.
