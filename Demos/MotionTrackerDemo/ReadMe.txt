Creators:
Created by undergraduates in the Spring of 2007.

Goal:
The demo's goal is to reach towards a moving object after the object has terminated its motion.

- Typically, a human operator will shake/wave his hand in front of the robot. The visual system will
track this motion. 
- The operator will move its hand to a location where there is an object that should be
reached/grabbed by the robot. 
- The operator should then halt moving its arm/body. 
- The robot will reach that location.
